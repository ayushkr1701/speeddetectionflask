1. In the terminal (Command prompt is preferrable if your windows doesn’t allow scripts in code editor terminal.), create a virtual environment by using ‘virtualenv -p python3.9 myvirenv’ (because I used python 3.9 while developing it).

2. In the same way as above, type ‘myvirenv\scripts\activate’ to start the virtual environment. 

3. Run ‘pip install -r requirements.txt’ to install all the dependencies being used. 

4. After all the dependencies are installed, run ‘python app.py’ to start the server.
